# 🛡️ CsuXac – Ultimate Minecraft Anti-Cheat Infrastructure

*A Kotlin-Native, Zero-Trust, Multi-Layered, AI-Driven Security Core for High-Scale Minecraft Servers*

## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Run the anti-cheat system
./gradlew run

# Run tests
./gradlew test
```

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

CsuXac implements a **Triad Defense Framework** with three parallel, independent security layers:

1. **Server-Side Behavioral Engine (SBE)** - Real-time player behavior analysis
2. **Network-Level Anomaly Filter (NAF)** - Protocol validation and packet analysis  
3. **Client-Side Integrity Verifier (CIV)** - Native agent for client-side detection

## 🔧 Requirements

- Kotlin 1.9+
- Java 17+
- Gradle 8.0+
- Redis (for clustering)
- Linux kernel 5.0+ (for advanced security features)
